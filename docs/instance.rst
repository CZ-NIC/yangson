The *instance* module implements the following classes:

* :class:`InstanceNode`: Abstract class for instance nodes.
* :class:`RootNode`: Root of the data tree.
* :class:`ObjectMember`: Instance node that is an object member.
* :class:`ArrayEntry`: Instance node that is an array entry.
* :class:`InstanceRoute`: Route into an instance value.

Doctest__ snippets for this module use the data model and instance
document from :ref:`sec-ex2`.

.. doctest::

   >>> dm = DataModel.from_file('yang-library-ex2.json',
   ... [".", "../../../yang-modules/ietf"])
   >>> with open('example-data.json') as infile:
   ...   ri = json.load(infile)
   >>> inst = dm.from_raw(ri)

.. class:: InstanceNode(key: InstanceKey, value: Value, \
       parinst: Optional[InstanceNode], \
       schema_node: DataNode, timestamp: datetime.datetime)

   The *key* argument is the key of the instance in the parent
   structure, i.e. either :term:`instance name` for an
   :class:`ObjectMember` or integer index for an
   :class:`ArrayEntry`. The key becomes the last component of the
   :attr:`path` attribute. Other constructor arguments contain values
   for instance attributes of the same name.

   This class and its subclasses implement the *zipper* interface for
   instance data along the lines of Gérard Huet's original
   paper [Hue97]_, only adapted for the specifics of JSON-like
   structures. An important property of the zipper interface is that
   it makes the underlying data structure persistent__: any changes to
   the data realized through the methods of the :class:`InstanceNode`
   class return an updated *copy* of the original instance without
   changing the latter. As much as possible, the data are shared
   between the original instance and the updated copy.

   __ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure

   Whilst the zipper interface slightly complicates access to instance
   data, it provides the advantages of persistent structures that are
   known from functional programming languages:

   * The structures are thread-safe.

   * It is easy to edit the data and then return to the original
     version, for example if new version isn't valid according to the
     data model.

   * Staging datastores, such as *candidate* in NETCONF (sec. `8.3`_
     in [RFC6241]_) can be implemented in a space-efficient way.

   .. rubric:: Instance Attributes

   .. attribute:: parinst

      Parent instance node, or ``None`` for the root node.

   .. attribute:: schema_node

      Data node in the schema corresponding to the instance node.

   .. attribute:: timestamp

      The date and time when the instance node was last modified.

   .. attribute:: value

      Scalar or structured value of the node, see module :mod:`.instvalue`.

   The arguments of the :class:`InstanceNode` constructor provide
   values for instance attributes of the same name.

   .. rubric:: Properties

   .. attribute:: name

      The :term:`instance name` of the receiver. For an
      :class:`ArrayEntry` instance it is by definition the same as the
      qualified name of the parent :class:`ObjectMember`.

   .. attribute:: namespace

      The :term:`namespace identifier` of the instance node.

   .. attribute:: path

      Path of the instance in the data tree: a tuple containing keys
      of the ancestor nodes and the instance itself.

   .. attribute:: qual_name

      The :term:`qualified name` of the receiver. For an
      :class:`ArrayEntry` instance it is by definition the same as the
      qualified name of the parent :class:`ObjectMember`.

   An :class:`InstanceNode` structure can be created from scratch, or
   read from JSON text using :meth:`.DataModel.from_raw` (see the
   doctest snippet above).

   The internal representation of :class:`InstanceNode` values is very
   similar to the JSON encoding of data modelled with
   YANG [RFC7951]_. In particular, member names have to be in the form
   specified in sec. `4`_ of that document:

   .. productionlist::
      member-name: [identifier ":"] identifier

   where the first identifier is a module name and the second is a
   data node name. The longer (namespace-qualified) form is used if
   and only if the member is defined in a different YANG module than
   its parent.

   .. doctest::

      >>> inst.value["example-2:bag"]["bar"]
      True

   A structured :class:`InstanceNode` value is represented as either
   :class:`~.instvalue.ObjectValue` (subclass of :class:`dict`) or
   :class:`~.instvalue.ArrayValue` (subclass of :class:`list`), see
   :mod:`.instvalue` module for details. The representation of a
   scalar value depends on its type (see :mod:`datatype`
   module). Structured values, and some scalar values as well, are
   *not* the same as the values provided by the generic JSON parsing
   functions :func:`json.load` and :func:`json.loads`. Therefore,
   values read from JSON text need some additional processing, or
   “cooking”. *Yangson* methods such as :meth:`.DataModel.from_raw`
   take care of this step.

   .. doctest::

      >>> type(inst.value)
      <class 'yangson.instvalue.ObjectValue'>

   Inside the larger structure of a data tree, an
   :class:`InstanceNode` represents “focus” on a particular node of
   the structure. The focus can be moved to a neighbour instance node
   (parent, child, sibling) and the value of an instance node can be
   created, deleted and updated by using the methods described
   below. Each of the methods returns a new :class:`InstanceNode` that
   shares, as much as possible, portions of the surrounding data tree
   with the original instance node.  However, any modifications to the
   new instance node – if performed through the methods of the
   :class:`InstanceNode` class and its subclasses – leave other
   instance nodes intact.

   Most methods for moving the focus inside the zipper structure and
   updating the value of an instance node are defined in the
   :class:`InstanceNode`, additional methods that are specific to an
   :class:`ObjectMember` or :class:`ArrayEntry` are defined in the
   respective class.

   .. rubric:: Public Methods

   .. automethod:: __str__

      If the receiver's value is a scalar, then the result is the
      :term:`canonical representation` of the value, if it is defined
      for the value's type (see sec. `9`_ in [RFC7950]_). Otherwise,
      the result is the value returned by Python standard function
      :class:`str`.

   .. automethod:: json_pointer() -> JSONPointer

   .. method:: __getitem__(key: InstanceKey) -> InstanceNode

      This method allows for selecting receiver's member or entry
      using square brackets as it is usual for other Python sequence
      types. The argument *key* is

      * an integer index, if the receiver's value is an array
        (negative indices are also supported), or

      * an :term:`instance name`, if the receiver's value is an object.

      The value returned by this method is either an
      :class:`ObjectMember` or :class:`ArrayEntry`.

      This method raises :exc:`~.InstanceValueError` if receiver's value
      is not structured, and :exc:`~.NonexistentInstance` if the member
      or entry identified by *key* doesn't exist in the actual
      receiver's value.

      .. doctest::

         >>> bag = inst['example-2:bag']
         >>> foo = bag['foo']
         >>> foo.path
         ('example-2:bag', 'foo')
         >>> foo.json_pointer()
         '/example-2:bag/foo'
         >>> bag['baz']
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         yangson.instance.NonexistentInstance: [/example-2:bag] member baz
         >>> foo6 = foo[0]
         >>> foo6.value['number']
         6
         >>> fool = foo[-1]
         >>> fool.value['in-words']
         'eight'
         >>> foo[4]
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         yangson.instance.NonexistentInstance: [/example-2:bag/foo] entry 4

   .. method:: __iter__()

      Return receiver's iterator.

      If the receiver's value is an object, then this method returns
      simply the value's iterator that can be used exactly as a Python
      dictionary iterator:

      .. doctest::

         >>> sorted([m for m in bag])
         ['bar', 'foo']

      However, if the receiver's value is an array, the returned
      iterator yields successive :class:`ArrayEntry` instances:

      .. doctest::

         >>> [e.json_pointer() for e in foo]
         ['/example-2:bag/foo/0', '/example-2:bag/foo/1', '/example-2:bag/foo/2', '/example-2:bag/foo/3']

      An attempt to iterate over an :class:`InstanceNode` that has a
      scalar value raises :exc:`~.InstanceValueError`.

   .. method:: is_internal() -> bool

      Return ``True`` if the receiver is an instance of an internal
      schema node, i.e. its :attr:`schema_node` is an
      :class:`~.schemanode.InternalNode`. Otherwise return ``False``.

      .. doctest::

         >>> inst.is_internal()
         True

   .. method:: put_member(name: InstanceName, value: Union[RawValue, \
           Value], raw: bool = False) -> InstanceNode

      Return receiver's member *name* with a new value specified by the
      *value* argument. The *raw* flag has to be set to ``True`` if
      *value* is a :term:`raw value`.

      If member *name* doesn't exist in the receiver's value, it is
      created (provided that the schema permits it).

      This method raises :exc:`~.InstanceValueError` if the receiver's
      value is not an object, and :exc:`~.NonexistentSchemaNode` if the
      schema doesn't permit member *name*.

      .. doctest::

         >>> nbar = bag.put_member('bar', False)
         >>> nbar.value
         False
         >>> bag.value['bar']  # bag is unchanged
         True
         >>> e2bag = bag.put_member('baz', 3.1415926).up()  # baz is created
         >>> sorted(e2bag.value.keys())
         ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
         >>> bag.put_member('quux', 0)
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         yangson.schemanode.NonexistentSchemaNode: quux in module example-2

   .. method:: delete_item(key: InstanceKey) -> InstanceNode

      Return a new instance node that is an exact copy of the
      receiver, except that item *key* is deleted from its value.

      This method raises :exc:`~.InstanceValueError` if the receiver's
      value is a scalar, and:exc:`~.NonexistentInstance` if the item
      isn't present in the actual receiver's value.

      .. doctest::

         >>> xbag = e2bag.delete_item('baz')
         >>> sorted(xbag.value.keys())
         ['bar', 'foo']
         >>> sorted(e2bag.value.keys())  # e2bag is unvchanged
         ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
         >>> xfoo = foo.delete_item(0)
         >>> len(xfoo.value)
         3
         >>> len(foo.value)   # foo is unchanged
         4

   .. method:: look_up(**keys: Dict[InstanceName, ScalarValue]) -> ArrayEntry

      Return an instance node corresponding to the receiver's entry
      with specified keys. The receiver must be a YANG list.

      The keys are passed to this method as a sequence of keyword
      arguments ``kwarg=value`` where ``kwarg`` is the :term:`instance
      name`\ s of a list key, and ``value`` is the corresponding list
      key value.

      This method raises :exc:`~.InstanceValueError` if the receiver is
      not a YANG list, and :exc:`~.NonexistentInstance` if no entry with
      matching keys exists.

      .. doctest::

         >>> foo8 = foo.look_up(number=8)
         >>> foo8.json_pointer()
         '/example-2:bag/foo/3'

   .. method:: up() -> InstanceNode

      Return an instance node corresponding to the receiver's parent.

      This method raises :exc:`~.NonexistentInstance` if the receiver is
      the root of the data tree and thus has no parent.

      .. doctest::

         >>> foo.up().name
         'example-2:bag'
         >>> inst.up()
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         yangson.instance.NonexistentInstance: [/] up of top

   .. automethod:: top() -> InstanceNode

      .. doctest::

         >>> e2inst = e2bag.top()
         >>> e2inst.value['example-2:bag']['baz']
         3.1415926

   .. method:: update(value: Union[RawValue, Value], raw: bool = \
           False) -> InstanceNode

      Return a new instance node that is a copy of the receiver with a
      value specified by the *value* argument. The *raw* flag has to
      be set to ``True`` if *value* is a :term:`raw value`.

      .. doctest::

         >>> ebar = bag['bar'].update(False)
         >>> ebar.value
         False

      In the following example, the string ``'2.7182818'`` is an
      acceptable :term:`raw value` for the *baz* leaf whose type is
      **decimal64** (see sec. `6.1`_ in [RFC7951]_). Since the *raw*
      flag is set, the :meth:`update` method “cooks” the raw value
      first into the Python's :class:`decimal.Decimal` type.

      .. doctest::

         >>> e3baz = e2bag['baz'].update('2.7182818', raw=True)
         >>> e3baz.value
         Decimal('2.7182818')
         >>> e2bag['foo'][0]['in-words'].update(66, raw=True)
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         yangson.exceptions.RawTypeError: [/example-2:bag/foo/0/in-words] expected string value

   .. method:: goto(iroute: InstanceRoute) -> InstanceNode

      Return an :class:`InstanceNode` corresponding to a target
      instance arbitrarily deep inside the receiver's value. The
      argument *iroute* is an :class:`InstanceRoute` (relative to the
      receiver) that identifies the target instance.

      The easiest way for obtaining an :class:`InstanceRoute` is to
      parse it either from a :term:`resource identifier` or
      :term:`instance identifier` using methods
      :meth:`.DataModel.parse_resource_id` and
      :meth:`.DataModel.parse_instance_id`, respectively.

      .. doctest::

         >>> irt = dm.parse_resource_id('/example-2:bag/foo=3/in-words')
         >>> irt2 = dm.parse_instance_id('/example-2:bag/baz')

      This method may raise the following exceptions:

      * :exc:`~.InstanceValueError` if *iroute* isn't compatible with
        the schema
      * :exc:`~.NonexistentInstance` if the target instance doesn't
        exist in the receiver's value
      * :exc:`~.NonDataNode` if the target instance represents an RPC
        operation, action or notification (*iroute* can come from a
        RESTCONF :term:`resource identifier`).

      .. doctest::

         >>> inst.goto(irt).value
         'three'
         >>> inst.goto(irt2)
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         yangson.instance.NonexistentInstance: [/example-2:bag] member baz

   .. method:: peek(iroute: InstanceRoute) -> Optional[Value]

      Return the value of a target instance arbitrarily deep inside
      the receiver's value. The argument *iroute* is an
      :class:`InstanceRoute` (relative to the receiver) that
      identifies the target instance. ``None`` is returned if the
      target instance doesn't exist.

      .. doctest::

         >>> inst.peek(irt)
         'three'

      .. CAUTION:: This method doesn't create a new instance, so the
         access to the returned value should in general be read-only.
         Any modifications of the returned value also affect the
         receiver, as shown in the next example. This means that the
         persistence property for the receiver is lost.

      .. doctest::

         >>> irt3 = dm.parse_resource_id('/example-2:bag/foo=3')
         >>> e2inst.peek(irt3)['in-words'] = 'tres'
         >>> e2inst.value['example-2:bag']['foo'][1]['in-words'] # changed!
         'tres'

   .. method:: validate(scope: ValidationScope = ValidationScope.all, \
           ctype: ContentType = ContentType.config) -> None

      Perform validation on the receiver's value. The *scope* argument
      determines the validation scope. The options are as follows:

      * ``ValidationScope.syntax`` – verifies schema constraints
        (taking into account **if-feature** and **when** statements,
        if present) and data types.

      * ``ValidationScope.semantics`` – verifies **must** constraints,
        uniqueness of list keys, **unique** constraints in list nodes,
        and integrity of **leafref** references.

      * ``ValidationScope.all`` – performs all checks from both items
        above.

      The value of the *ctype* argument belongs to the
      :class:`~.enumerations.ContentType` enumeration and specifies
      whether the receiver's value is to be validated as configuration
      (``Content.config``) or as both configuration and state data
      (``Content.all``).

      The method returns ``None`` if the validation succeeds,
      otherwise one of the following exceptions is raised:

      * :exc:`~.SchemaError` – if the value doesn't conform to the schema,
      * :exc:`~.SemanticError` – if the value violates a semantic constraint.
      * :exc:`~.YangTypeError` – if the value is a scalar of incorrect data type.

      .. doctest::

         >>> inst.validate() # no output means OK
         >>> badinst = bag.put_member('baz', 'ILLEGAL').top()
         >>> badinst.validate()
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         yangson.schemanode.YangTypeError: [/example-2:bag/baz] invalid type: 'ILLEGAL'

      In the following example, member ``baz`` is not allowed because
      it is a conditional leaf and its **when** constraint evaluates
      to ``False``.

      .. doctest::

         >>> e2foo6 = e2bag['foo'][0]
         >>> bad2 = e2foo6.update(
         ... {'number': 42, 'in-words': 'forty-two'}, raw=True).top()
         >>> bad2.validate()
         Traceback (most recent call last):
         ...
         yangson.schemanode.SchemaError: [/example-2:bag] not allowed: member 'baz'

   .. method:: add_defaults(ctype: ContentType = None) -> InstanceNode

      Return a new instance node that is a copy of the receiver
      extended with default values specified the data model. Only
      default values that are “in use” are added, see sections
      `7.6.1`_ and `7.7.2`_ in [RFC7950]_.

      The argument *ctype* restricts the content type of data nodes
      whose default values will be added. For example, setting it to
      ``ContentType.config`` means that only default values of
      configuration nodes will be added. If *ctype* is ``None``
      (default), the content type of added defaults will be the same
      as the content type of the receiver.

      .. doctest::

         >>> wd = inst.add_defaults()
         >>> wd.value['example-2:bag']['baz']
         Decimal('0E-7')
         >>> wd.value['example-2:bag']['foo'][0]['prime']
         False

   .. automethod:: raw_value() -> RawValue

      .. doctest::

         >>> wd['example-2:bag']['baz'].raw_value()
         '0.0'

       Dict[InstanceName, Value], value: Value, parinst: \
       InstanceNode, schema_node: DataNode, timestamp: \
       datetime.datetime)

   This class represents an instance node that is a member of an
   object. It is a subclass of :class:`InstanceNode`. The additional
   constructor arguments *name* and *siblings* provide values for
   instance variables of the same name. Other arguments of the
   constructor have the same meaning as in :class:`InstanceNode`.

   .. rubric:: Instance Attributes

   .. attribute:: siblings

      Dictionary of the receiver's siblings (other members of the
      parent object).

   .. rubric:: Public Methods

   .. method:: sibling(name: InstanceName) -> ObjectMember

      Return the instance node corresponding to sibling member *name*.

      This method raises :exc:`~.NonexistentSchemaNode` if member *name*
      is not permitted by the parent's schema, and
      :exc:`~.NonexistentInstance` if sibling member *name* doesn't
      exist.

      .. doctest::

         >>> foo.sibling('bar').json_pointer()
         '/example-2:bag/bar'

.. class:: ArrayEntry(key: int, before: List[Value], after: List[Value], value: \
       Value, parinst: InstanceNode, schema_node: \
       DataNode, timestamp: datetime.datetime)

   This class is a subclass of :class:`InstanceNode`, and represents
   an instance node that is an entry of an array, i.e. list or
   leaf-list.  The additional constructor arguments *before* and
   *after* provide values for instance variables of the same
   name. Other arguments have the same meaning as in
   :class:`InstanceNode`.

   .. rubric:: Instance Attributes

   .. attribute:: before

      Entries of the parent array that precede the receiver.

   .. attribute:: after

      Entries of the parent array that follow the receiver.

   .. rubric:: Properties

   .. attribute:: index

      The receiver's index within the parent array.

      .. doctest::

         >>> foo6.index
         0
         >>> foo6.name  # inherited from parent
         'foo'

   .. rubric:: Public Methods

   .. method:: previous() -> ArrayEntry

      Return an instance node corresponding to the previous entry in
      the parent array.

      This method raises :exc:`~.NonexistentInstance` if the receiver
      is the first entry of the parent array.

      .. doctest::

         >>> foo8.previous().json_pointer()
         '/example-2:bag/foo/2'

         yangson.instance.NonexistentInstance: [/example-2:bag/foo/0] previous of first

   .. method:: next() -> ArrayEntry

      Return an instance node corresponding to the next entry in the
      parent array.

      This method raises :exc:`~.NonexistentInstance` if the receiver is
      the last entry of the parent array.

      .. doctest::

         >>> foo6.next().json_pointer()
         '/example-2:bag/foo/1'

           = False) -> ArrayEntry

      Insert a new entry before the receiver and return an instance
      node corresponding to the new entry. The *value* argument
      specifies the value of the new entry, and the *raw* flag has to be
      set to ``True`` if *value* is a :term:`raw value`.

      .. doctest::

         >>> foo4 = foo8.insert_before({'number': 4, 'in-words': 'four'}, raw=True)
         >>> [en['number'] for en in foo4.up().value]
         [6, 3, 7, 4, 8]

   .. method:: insert_after(value: Union[RawValue, Value], raw: bool \
           = False) -> ArrayEntry

      Insert a new entry after the receiver and return an instance
      node corresponding to the new entry. The *value* argument
      specifies the value of the new entry, and the *raw* flag has to
      be set to ``True`` if *value* is a :term:`raw value`.

      .. doctest::

         >>> foo5 = foo4.insert_after({'number': 5, 'in-words': 'five'}, raw=True)
         >>> [en['number'] for en in foo5.up().value]
         [6, 3, 7, 4, 5, 8]
